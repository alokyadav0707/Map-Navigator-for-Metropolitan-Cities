# Map-Navigator-for-Metropolitan-Cities
This project uses C++ and graph algorithms to create an efficient navigation system for metropolitan areas.
It features a multi-criteria route optimization algorithm that minimizes distance and travel time, while accounting for real-world constraints like traffic and road conditions.
By enhancing Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, it achieves an efficient time complexity of O((V + E) log V).
The solution incorporates metro transit options and prioritizes waiting and travel times using a priority queue.
Designed to be dynamic and scalable, it provides accurate, real-time route recommendations, making it ideal for modern urban transit systems.
